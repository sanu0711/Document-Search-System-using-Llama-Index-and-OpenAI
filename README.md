## Overview
Document Search System using Llama Index and OpenAI is an AI-powered solution for efficient document querying. It uses Llama Index for vector-based indexing and OpenAI's GPT to interpret natural language queries, providing accurate search results. The system supports persistent indexing for fast, repeated queries and customizable similarity thresholds to ensure relevant document retrieval. Perfect for scalable, intelligent document search across large datasets.

## Objective
This project demonstrates how to create a vector-based retrieval system using `llama-index` for document querying. The project uses OpenAI's GPT model to answer natural language queries based on pre-loaded document data.


## **Features**
- Use of **Llama Index** to build a document index.
- Persistent document indexing for faster queries.
- Implementation of **OpenAI GPT** for natural language query handling.
- Interactive querying and response printing.
